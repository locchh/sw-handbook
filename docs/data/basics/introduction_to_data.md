# Introduction to Data

Data is everywhere.

## What is Data?

- Derived from `datum`: given, fact.
- Valuable resource in this digital era.

## Data context

Information that provides meaning to data
- When the data was collected?
- Where the data was collected?
- How the data was collected?
- Who collected the data?
- Why the data was collected?

These characteristics of data are called the **metadata**.

## Type of data

Classification of data based on their structure:
- Structured data
- Semi-structured data
- Unstructured data

Classification of data based on their nature: 
- Quantitative data
- Qualitative data

## Data storage is changing

**Historical data storage**
- Genetic information in DNA.
- Cave and wall paintings.
- Scroll and books of papyrus/parchment.

**19th and 20th century**
- Punch cards.
- Magnetic tape, floppy disks.

**20th and 21st century**
- More data on smaller media.
- CDs and hard/solid state drives(local).
- Data centers (cloud).

## The DIKW pyramid

```
Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Wisdom
```

**Raw data**
- unprocessed data.

**Creating information**
- Information is (organized) data with **context**.

**Knowledge is power**:
- Information alone doesn't lead to decisions.
- Connecting all the dots of information.
- Knowledge is information with **meaning**.

**Archiving wisdom**
- The hardest part
- Insights: add more meaning to information by linking pieces.
- Apply the knowledge for better decisions.

## From data to decision

```
Ask questions -> Gather data -> Prepare data -> Conduct Analysis -> Make decision
```

## Data as a resource

**Overwhelming data**

- Data is often too large in its raw form. Even "simple" analysis require large amount of data.

- More complex analysis can leverage even million or billion of records.

**Data aggregation**

Aggregation is the process to summarize a dataset into a smaller pieces (easier to understand) is required to make informed decisions.

Common aggregation:
- Simple average (mean)
- Sum (totals)
- Minimum or Maximum
- Modes

Aggregation appear in many ways throughout organizations.
- Metrics
- Benchmarks
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Understanding how these aggregations are created is extremely helpful for many investigations.


## Key concepts

**Data flow**

Data flow within organizations is often  highly complex.

- Data from many different sources systems
- Processed through other systems
- Displayed and manipulated in other systems.

**Data management**
Data management is responsible trying to unify and standardize data from many different data flows. These 

**Data governance**
Ensure data is consistent, trustworthy, and isn't misused.

**Data quality**
Ensure data is accurate, complete, consistent, and up-to-date.

**Data Privacy and Security**
Ensure proper data access, use, and protection.

## Principles of data ethics

- Permission for 
- Transparency about the plan
- Privacy of data
- Good intentions
- Consider the outcome

## Data lifecycle

```
Planning -> Collection -> Storage -> Management -> Cleaning and processing -> Analysis and Visualization -> Sharing -> Archiving/destroying
```

## Common mistakes about data
- Not having a clear goal or question
- Insufficient or wrong data (data bias, dirty data,etc.)
- Lack of appropriate analysis (lack of context, wrong metrics,etc.)
- No clear communication of results
