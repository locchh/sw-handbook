# Introduction to Data

Data is everywhere.

## What is Data?

## Data context

Information that provides meaning to data
- When the data was collected?

These characteristics of data are called the **metadata**.

## The DIKW pyramid


```
Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Wisdom
```

**Raw data**
- unprocessed data.

**Creating information**
- Information is (organized) data with **context**.

**Knowledge is power**:
- Information alone doesn't lead to decisions.
- Connecting all the dots of information.
- Knowledge is information with **meaning**.

**Archiving wisdom**
- The hardest part
- Insights: add more meaning to information by linking pieces.
- Apply the knowledge for better decisions.

## From data to decision

```
Ask questions -> Gather data -> Prepare data -> Conduct Analysis -> Make decision
```
