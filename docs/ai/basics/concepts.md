# AI Concepts

## Solution Types

### Rule-based

*There are hidden rules in every system. Rules to govern the sentences we write, the software we code and the music we play.*

### Statistical
- Probabilistic models and pattern recognition
- Bayesian inference and uncertainty quantification
- Statistical learning theory and generalization
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model evaluation and validation

### Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Ensemble methods and model stacking
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

### Deep Learning
- Neural network architectures
- Backpropagation and gradient descent
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Transformer models
- Attention mechanisms and self-attention

### Generative AI
- Large Language Model (LLM)
- Multi-modal LLM

### AI Agents
