# Basic Software Engineering Concepts

## Chomsky Hierarchy

The **Chomsky Hierarchy** is a classification of formal grammars (and the languages they generate) into four types, organized from the most general (most expressive) to the most restricted (least expressive).

It’s a core concept in **formal language theory**, automata theory, and compiler design — originally introduced by **Noam Chomsky** in 1956 to describe the structure of natural languages but now widely used in computer science.

### The Four Levels of the Chomsky Hierarchy

| **Type**   | **Grammar Name**               | **Language Class**               | **Equivalent Automaton**                                                        | **Rules / Restrictions**                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type 0** | **Unrestricted grammar**       | Recursively enumerable languages | **Turing Machine**                                                              | No restrictions on productions: α → β, where α and β are any strings of terminals/nonterminals and α ≠ ε. |
| **Type 1** | **Context-sensitive grammar**  | Context-sensitive languages      | **Linear bounded automaton** (Turing machine with tape limited to input length) | Productions of the form αAβ → αγβ, where γ ≠ ε (length of output ≥ length of input)                       |
| **Type 2** | **Context-free grammar (CFG)** | Context-free languages           | **Pushdown Automaton (PDA)**                                                    | Productions of the form A → γ, where A is a single nonterminal                                            |
| **Type 3** | **Regular grammar**            | Regular languages                | **Finite State Automaton (FSA)**                                                | Productions of the form A → aB or A → a (right-linear or left-linear)                                     |

### Why It Matters

* **Compiler design**:

  * Regular languages → Lexical analysis (regex, tokenizing)
  * Context-free languages → Syntax analysis (parsing)
* **Theoretical computer science**: Helps in **classifying computational problems** by their complexity.
* **Natural language processing**: Models grammatical structures of human languages.

### Example of Restrictions

Let’s see an example where a grammar moves down the hierarchy:

1. **Type 0**:

   ```
   S → aSb | ε
   ```

   (No restrictions — works fine in Type 0 and all below if it matches the form.)

2. **Type 1**: Must be length non-decreasing:

   ```
   AB → AC  
   C → b
   ```

3. **Type 2**: Only single nonterminal on LHS:

   ```
   S → aSb | ε
   ```

4. **Type 3**: Only one terminal on RHS and at most one nonterminal:

   ```
   S → aA  
   A → bS | ε
   ```

## Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigms are fundamental styles or approaches to programming that shape how solutions are designed and implemented. Below are some of the major paradigms:

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Key Concepts:** Objects, Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism
**Languages:** Java, C++, Python, C#, Ruby
**Description:**
OOP organizes code around **objects**, which are instances of **classes**—blueprints that define attributes and behaviors. It promotes code **reuse**, **modularity**, and **scalability**, making it ideal for large and complex software systems.

### 2. Functional Programming (FP)

**Key Concepts:** Pure Functions, Immutability, First-Class Functions, Higher-Order Functions
**Languages:** Haskell, Lisp, Elixir, Scala, JavaScript (partial)
**Description:**
FP emphasizes **declarative code** using pure functions and avoids mutable state and side effects. It’s rooted in **mathematical functions** and is well-suited for concurrent and parallel programming.

### 3. Procedural Programming (PP)

**Key Concepts:** Procedures (Functions), Sequence, Selection, Iteration
**Languages:** C, Pascal, Fortran, BASIC
**Description:**
Procedural programming structures programs as a series of **instructions** grouped into **procedures** or **routines**. It is a subset of imperative programming and is suitable for applications with a clear step-by-step logic.

### 4. Declarative Programming (DP)

**Key Concepts:** What to Do (Not How), Abstraction, Constraints
**Languages:** SQL, HTML, Prolog, Haskell
**Description:**
Declarative programming expresses the **logic of computation** without describing its control flow. The focus is on **what** the program should accomplish rather than detailing **how** to achieve it.

### 5. Logic Programming (LP)

**Key Concepts:** Facts, Rules, Queries, Inference
**Languages:** Prolog, Datalog
**Description:**
Logic programming is based on **formal logic**. Programs consist of a set of facts and rules, and computation is performed through **logical inference**. It is widely used in **AI**, **natural language processing**, and **expert systems**.

## Code Component Levels

### 1. Expression / Statement

**Description:**
The most basic unit of code that performs an action or produces a value.
**Examples:**

```python
x = 5         # Statement  
y = x + 2     # Expression within a statement
```

### 2. Function

**Description:**
A reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task, often with inputs (parameters) and outputs (return values).
**Example:**

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

### 3. Class

**Description:**
A blueprint for creating objects. Classes group related data and methods (functions) together, supporting object-oriented design.
**Example:**

```python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b
```

### 4. File

**Description:**
A physical file (e.g., `.py`, `.js`) containing source code, which may include multiple functions, classes, or even runnable scripts.
**Example:**
`calculator.py` might contain all calculator-related classes and functions.

### 5. Module

**Description:**
A file or collection of files that define a namespace and can be imported into other files. Modules allow encapsulation and reuse.
**Example:**

```python
import math
from calculator import add
```

### 6. Sub-package, Name-space package

**Description:**
A sub-package is a package contained within another package (a nested directory structure). It helps organize larger packages into logical groups, e.g., `utils/text/` under `utils/`.

A namespace package is a logical package that can be spread across multiple directories on `sys.path` (in Python, enabled by PEP 420). Unlike regular packages, a namespace package may not have a single `__init__.py` file and can be extended by separate distributions.
**Examples:**

Regular package with sub-packages:

```
myapp/
  utils/
    __init__.py
    text/
      __init__.py
      tokenize.py
    math/
      __init__.py
      stats.py
```

```python
from myapp.utils.text import tokenize
```

Namespace package (pieces located in multiple roots on sys.path):

```
/src/pkg_a/acme/plugins/foo.py
/src/pkg_b/acme/plugins/bar.py
```

```python
# When both /src/pkg_a and /src/pkg_b are on sys.path
from acme.plugins import foo, bar
```

### 7. Package

**Description:**
A collection of related modules organized in a directory with an optional `__init__.py` file. Packages help group functionality logically.
**Example:**
`numpy`, `scikit-learn`, or your own directory like `myutils/`

### 8. Project

**Description:**
A complete application or system that may consist of multiple packages, configurations, tests, and documentation.
**Example:**
A Django web app or a machine learning pipeline.

### 9. Platform

**Description:**
A larger ecosystem or environment where projects are deployed, integrated, or distributed. May include OS, runtime environments, SDKs, or cloud infrastructure.

## Layers in Software Architecture

Software systems are often organized into logical layers, each responsible for a specific concern. This separation helps manage complexity, supports scalability, and improves testability.

### 1. Data Layer (Persistence Layer)

**Responsibility:**
Manages **storage**, **retrieval**, and **manipulation** of data from databases, file systems, or external APIs.
**Key Components:**

* Database access (SQL, ORM)
* Data models / entities
* Repositories / DAOs
  **Examples:**
* PostgreSQL, MongoDB
* SQLAlchemy, Hibernate
* `UserRepository`, `ProductDAO`

### 2. Application / Business Layer (Service Layer)

**Responsibility:**
Implements **business logic** and rules. It coordinates between the data and presentation layers, encapsulating core operations of the application.
**Key Components:**

* Services
* Use cases
* Domain logic
  **Examples:**
* `OrderService`, `AuthManager`
* Validating input, calculating discounts, enforcing rules

### 3. Presentation Layer (UI Layer)

**Responsibility:**
Handles **user interaction** and displays output. This layer communicates with the application layer to send input and present results.
**Key Components:**

* Web or mobile UI
* Controllers / ViewModels
* Frontend frameworks
  **Examples:**
* HTML, React, Flutter
* `LoginController`, `DashboardPage`

### Optional Extensions

If you're interested in a more complex architecture (like enterprise systems), you might also include:

* **API Layer:** For REST/GraphQL endpoints that expose services to clients.
* **Integration Layer:** Manages communication with external systems and services (e.g., third-party APIs).
* **Security Layer:** Handles authentication, authorization, and encryption across layers.
