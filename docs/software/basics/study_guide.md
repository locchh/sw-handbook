## 🚀 Coding Assistant Quick Guide

### 🚀 Starting a Project

**Setup & Structure**
- "Help me start this project: {design_doc}. Show me the folder structure and setup steps."
- "Give me the exact commands to run this on a fresh machine"
- "Create a minimal Dockerfile and docker-compose for local dev"

**Standards & Config**
- "Set up linters, formatters, and pre-commit hooks with configs"
- "What branching strategy and commit format should we use? Show examples."

---

### 💻 Building Features

**Implementation**
- "Plan out how to implement {feature_name}"
- "Build {functionality} with tests, comments, and edge cases"

**Debugging**
- "Fix this error: {error_message}. Stack trace: {stack_trace}"
- "Add logging/metrics to debug {component}. Show examples."

---

### 🔍 Understanding Code

**Codebase Overview**
- "What does this codebase do and how is it structured?"
- "Show me the core components and how they connect"
- "How does data flow through the system?"

**Deep Dives**
- "Explain the architecture of {component}"
- "What are the entry points and how do I run this locally?"
- "Explain {concept} with code examples"

---

### ✅ Quality & Deployment

**Review & Testing**
- "Give me a PR review checklist (security, tests, performance)"
- "What's the test coverage and strategy?"

**CI/CD & Docs**
- "Create a CI/CD pipeline config for GitHub Actions"
- "Write onboarding docs: setup → run → test → deploy"
- "Generate API docs (OpenAPI) for these endpoints"

---

### 🏗️ Platform Questions

**System Design**
- "Explain the platform architecture and component interactions"
- "How do components communicate and what are the dependencies?"
- "How is auth/authorization handled across services?"

**Operations**
- "What are failure points and resilience strategies?"
- "Show me deployment order, scaling strategy, and monitoring setup"

---

**Pro tip**: Always be specific—include file names, error messages, or feature names. The more context you give, the better the help you get.

## Universal Learning Formula

### Find the Right Resources

To learn any new technology effectively, focus on these three key resources:

* **Official Documentation:** Builds a solid foundation by explaining concepts, features, and usage as intended by the creators.
* **Example Codebases:** Helps you see how others use the technology in real-world scenarios and exposes you to best practices.
* **Open Source Implementations:** Allows you to dive deeper into the internals, core concepts, and underlying patterns.

### Rapid Learning Framework

#### Master the Fundamentals => Ask Coding Assisstant
- Grasp the core concepts before tackling advanced topics.
- Understand the problem the technology aims to solve.
- Learn essential mental models and paradigms (OOP, functional, reactive, etc.).

#### Apply the 80/20 Rule =>Ask Coding Assisstant
- Focus on the 20% of features that deliver 80% of the value.
- Prioritize high-impact concepts: data structures, algorithms, and design patterns.
- Leave rare or edge-case features for later, when necessary.

#### Build Projects Gradually
- Start small, using core features in simple projects.
- Increase project complexity as your confidence grows.
- Rebuild features from apps you admire to deepen understanding.

#### Practice with Intention
- Set clear learning goals with measurable outcomes.
- Use time management techniques like Pomodoro to stay focused.
- Regularly review and reinforce what you’ve learned.

#### Adopt a Testing Mindset
- Learn to write effective tests for your code.
- Understand testing frameworks and methodologies.
- Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) when suitable.

#### Leverage Documentation Wisely
- Start with official tutorials and beginner guides.
- Use API references regularly during practice.
- Explore sections on architecture and design philosophy for deeper insights.

#### Learn from the community
- Analyze open-source projects that use the technology
- Follow thought leaders and contributors on social media
- Participate in forums, Discord channels, and Stack Overflow

#### Master the tooling ecosystem
- Learn the build tools, package managers, and deployment pipelines
- Understand debugging and profiling tools
- Get comfortable with the IDE/editor features specific to the technology

#### Maintain a learning journal
- Document challenges, solutions, and insights
- Create cheat sheets for quick reference
- Build a personal knowledge base of patterns and anti-patterns

#### Prepare for interviews specifically
- Study common interview questions for the technology
- Practice explaining complex concepts in simple terms
- Prepare code samples demonstrating your proficiency

### Accelerated Learning Techniques

- **Spaced repetition**: Review concepts at increasing intervals
- **Teaching others**: Explain concepts to reinforce your understanding
- **Pair programming**: Work with more experienced developers
- **Code reviews**: Have your code reviewed and review others' code
- **Timeboxed exploration**: Set a time limit for solving problems before seeking help

### Confidence-Building Strategies

- Start contributing to open-source projects
- Build and deploy a complete application using the technology
- Create technical content (blog posts, videos) explaining concepts
- Participate in hackathons or coding competitions
- Conduct mock interviews with peers

### Measuring Progress

- Track the complexity of problems you can solve independently
- Monitor how quickly you can implement new features
- Note how often you need to reference documentation
- Gauge your ability to debug issues efficiently
- Assess how well you can explain the technology to others

### Additional aspects

#### Security Considerations

Neither the CodeBase nor Platform sections address security concerns specifically. You might want to add questions about:

- What are the security measures implemented in the codebase/platform?
- How are vulnerabilities identified and addressed?
- What is the process for security reviews and audits?

### Documentation Standards

While coding standards are mentioned, documentation standards are equally important:

- How is the codebase/platform documented?
- What documentation tools and formats are used?
- Where can I find up-to-date documentation?

### Onboarding Process

A section on onboarding could be valuable:

- What's the recommended path for new developers to get familiar with the codebase/platform?
- Are there any mentorship or buddy systems in place?
- What resources are available for newcomers?

### Troubleshooting and Debugging

Consider adding specific questions about:

- What are common issues and their solutions?
- What debugging tools and techniques are recommended?
- Where to look for logs and how to interpret them?

### Performance Considerations

Questions about:

- What are the performance bottlenecks?
- How is performance measured and monitored?
- What optimization techniques are used?
    
### Community and Support

While community learning is mentioned in the learning framework, you might want to add specific questions about:

- Where to get help when stuck?
- What are the active community channels?
- Who are the key maintainers or experts to follow? 

### Version Control and Collaboration

Consider adding questions about:

- What version control system is used and how?
- What is the branching strategy?
- How are code reviews conducted?
